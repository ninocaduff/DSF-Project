To-Do List

Preprocessing # Done till 2.12.2023 EOD

1. Create csv with new column "NO2 Next Day" as a target variable. --> DONE
2. Add Features to csv (speed limits, trees, etc.) to make prediction better --> Jonah is preparing this, Frederick will merge it into the model
3. Maybe? -> Remove Seasonality from Data --> Frederick has looked at this, he is confused, seems like there is seasonality, but idk what to do, there is also a slight donwards trend in the NO2 data, let's dicuss this

1. Add Trend Analysis in Preprocessing Section


IF WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH TIME:

Look at windspeed and direction and industries and see if No2 is higher when wind blows towards NO2 measurement device.
