Predicting Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Concentrations in Zurich

Our project is centered around developing a predictive model to estimate daily NO2 concentrations along streets in Zurich. 

The primary goal is to create a regression-based machine learning model that can reliably forecast NO2 levels. By using daily NO2 concentration data as our target variable, we aim to establish a correlation with a range of independent variables from separate datasets, including traffic metrics, weather conditions, seasonal and daily variations, humidity, and concentrations of other air pollutants. This project seeks to demonstrate how such a model can be a vital tool for policymakers, offering insights into the potential air quality impacts of urban planning decisions.

Our approach involves integrating data from three key sources:

1. Air Quality Dataset: Contains daily measurements of NO2 and other pollutants, serving as the foundation for our target variable.
2. Traffic Environmental Dataset: Includes detailed traffic counts for this location
3. Other datasets for parameters like temperature, wind speed, and humidity, relevant to Rosengartenstrasse.

We plan to utilize machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression to analyze the relationship between NO2 levels and our selected predictors. These methods are chosen for their effectiveness in handling multiple variables and their capability to provide interpretable results.

The importance of this project is twofold:

1.Public Health and Environmental Impact: Air quality is a significant concern, particularly in urban areas like Rosengartenstrasse. By accurately predicting NO2 levels, we can better understand and mitigate the health risks associated with air pollution.

2. Policy and Urban Planning: The ability to forecast the impact of traffic and environmental changes on air quality is crucial for policymakers. This model could serve as a decision-making tool, especially in scenarios like the once-proposed Rosengartentunnel. It offers a way to simulate the effects of traffic redirection or infrastructure developments on NO2 concentrations. Decision-makers can leverage these insights to formulate strategies that minimize air pollution, aligning with environmental and public health goals.

Beyond its immediate application in Zurich, this model could set a precedent for other cities facing similar challenges. It exemplifies how data-driven approaches can inform sustainable urban planning and environmental legislation. By integrating advanced analytics with policy development, we can pave the way for healthier, cleaner urban environments.
